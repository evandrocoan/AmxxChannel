If you do not like the `Amxmodx` menu created,
you can go on the Sublime Text menu `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`:
1. And delete the file `Main.sublime-menu` on the directory `User/Amxmodx/`
2. Open the file `User/AmxxChannel.json` and add the setting:

        "is_to_install_the_menu": false,
